### About This Project
For my final project with General Assembly, I wanted to do something that I would actually use and be passionate about building. As a huge Theme Park fan, I got the inspiration for this project while listening to a podcast where they joked about making an IMDB for Theme Parks.

### Special Thanks
I would like our instructors at General Assembly for their guidance along the way. This includes Brock Whitbread-Cole, James Sinkler, Seanny Phoenix, Jacob Kleiman, Uyen Lam, Michael Petty, among others. Additionally, I couldn't have done it without the "Party Bus" - (in no particular order) Jane Cho, Casey Jenkins, Lauren Nguyen, Jamie Cabrigas, Brock Molmen, Ashley Nguyen, and Kelsey Whallon.

 And lastly, thank you to all the theme parks and their creators for making such wonderful experiences.
